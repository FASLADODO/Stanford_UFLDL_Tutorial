In these folders you will find my solutions to the programming challenges
from Stanford's UFLDL (Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning) 
online tutorial on DNNs (deep learning neural networks) and CNNs
(convolutional neural networks):

As a neural-network-nerd at heart, I am always looking for better ways to 
improve my work, so please provide suggestions and send questions to 
rkdoshi@princeton.edu. Looking forward to hearing from you!
