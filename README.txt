In these folders you will find my solutions to the programming challenges
from Stanford's UFLDL online tutorial:

Please not that they have been modified and restructured for clarity purposes, 
so my solutions do not perfectly match the template provided by Stanford.

As a neural network nerd at heart, I am always looking for better ways to 
improve my work, so please provide suggestions and send questions to 
rkdoshi@princeton.edu. Looking forward to hearing from you!
