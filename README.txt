In these folders you will find my solutions to the programming challenges
from Stanford's UFLDL (Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning) 
online tutorial on DNNs (deep learning neural networks) and CNNs
(convolutional neural networks):

Please not that they have been modified and restructured for clarity purposes, 
so my solutions do not perfectly match the template provided by Stanford.

As a neural network nerd at heart, I am always looking for better ways to 
improve my work, so please provide suggestions and send questions to 
rkdoshi@princeton.edu. Looking forward to hearing from you!
